# scRNA-seq_simulation_Webvalley2020

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks about the simulation of single cell RNA-seq count data using SPARSim.

The official guide of SPARSim (sparsim_vignette.html) and the slides (Simulation_SingleCell.pdf) are also avaible in the repository.



The description about the simulation scenarios described by each notebook is available in the slides.

Some important notes: 

- **Example 4** and **Example 5** may require a considerable amount of resources (up to 8GB of RAM) and require several minutes of computation
- The documentation about SPARSim functions and parameter presets is available typing `?<function name>` (e.g. `?SPARSim_simulation`) or `?<presets_name>` (e.g. `?Zheng_param_preset`) inside a R shell.
- The official guide of SPARSim is available also typing `browseVignettes("SPARSim")` inside an R shell (it doesn't work in R shell from JypyterLab).
